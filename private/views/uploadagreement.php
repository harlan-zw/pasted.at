		<p>Broadly speaking, the site was created to help programmers. Any paste or usage pattern not related to that goal which results in unusually high traffic will be flagged for investigation. Your paste may be deleted and your IP blocked. In particular, please do not paste email lists, password lists or personal information. The "report abuse" feature can be used to flag such pastes and they will be deleted. Do not aggressively spider the site. Exceptions can be arranged, contact us to discuss. If you can access pasted.at from one location, but not another, it's likely your IP address has been blocked for violating this policy. Get in touch and the block can be lifted.
